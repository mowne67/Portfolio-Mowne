## [Project-1: John Hopkins COVID19 Data Exploration & Analysis with World Happiness Report](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/john_hopkins_covid_data.ipynb)

- Worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country.
- Another dataset called the world happiness report which consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
- The datasets were cleaned, merged and correlated to form relationships between the maximum infection rates and factors of happiness across countries.

## [Project-2: Digit Recognition of Handwritten Text with Tensorflow 1.x](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Digit_Recognition_from_Handwritten_Text_with_Tensorflow_1_x.ipynb)

- Used hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and built a neural network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
- Successfully trained that neural network to classify the MNIST dataset with around 92% accuracy.
- Used an older version of tensorflow (1.x)

## [Project-3: Handwritten Digit Recognition with Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras (Improved Project-2)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xykAjop1ye5miKYvZK6DG2T-S_gxBl1f?usp=sharing)
