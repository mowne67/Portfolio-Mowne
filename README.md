## ML Projects:
## [Transfer Learning with Natural Language Processing using Tensorflow Hub and TensorBoard](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Transfer_Learning_NLP_TF_Hub_with_TensorBoard.ipynb)

- Implemented various pre-trained NLP text embedding models from Tensorflow Hub
- Models are listed:
  - Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)
  - Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
  - Gnews Swivel
- Performed transfer learning to fine-tune models on Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
- Visualized model performance metrics with TensorBoard
- [Lighter Version of the project](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Transfer_Learning_NLP_TF_Hub_w_o_TensorBoard.ipynb)(without TensorBoard)

## [Data Exploration: John Hopkins University COVID19 Data Exploration & Analysis with World Happiness Report](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/john_hopkins_covid_data.ipynb)

- This is primarily a Data Exploration project and its about finding insights and various correlations using Visualisation.
- Worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in each Country.
- Another dataset called the world happiness report which consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
- The datasets were cleaned, merged and correlated to form relationships between the maximum infection rates and factors of happiness across countries.
- Contains relevant figures and plots.

## [Term Deposit Marketing Classification](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Bank_Marketing_Analytics.ipynb)

- Classified Term Deposit subscription with data from 40000+ calls made by a Portuguese banking institution.
- Trained and Tested Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN models. 
- Generated Synthetic samples from Minority class to diagnose class imbalance with SMOTE method.


## [Image Processing: Television Image Detector with CNNs using Tensorflow & Keras](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Television_Image_Detector.ipynb)

- An image processing system is designed that takes any image from the internet and detects the presence of a television in the image.
-  The convolutional neural network model is trained using a dataset that is created from scratch using an ImageScraper notebook which outputs a .csv file of image URLs from DuckDuckGo search images.
-  An accuracy of 82.81% is achieved from test set which is good for an Image Processing model that only has 850 training images with few layers in the neural network.

## [Handwritten Digit Recognition with Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras (Improved version)](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_Tensorflow_2_0_%26_Keras.ipynb)

- This project is an improved version of the previous Digit Recognition project as this is done with Keras.
- Used hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and built a neural network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
- Convolutional Neural Networks were built and flattened to later add dense layers, all done with Keras
- Accuracy of 98% is achieved by this model on the test data this time as opposed to 92% accuracy before.

## [Digit Recognition of Handwritten Text with Tensorflow 1.x](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Digit_Recognition_from_Handwritten_Text_with_Tensorflow_1_x.ipynb)

- Used hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and built a neural network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
- Successfully trained that neural network to classify the MNIST dataset with around 92% accuracy on the test data.
- Used an older version of tensorflow (1.x)

## Python Projects:

## [Wordcloud Creation from a textfile using Python](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/C1M6L2_Final_Project_V3.ipynb)

- A basic Guided Project completed under the course 'Crash Course for Python' provided by Coursera.
- The Instructor's complete guidances are included in the notebook and the internal functions are written by me.
- A wordcloud is obtained from any given textfile after processing the text through cleaning (removing symbols & uninteresting words, lowercasing, etc)
