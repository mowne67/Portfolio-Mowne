## ML Projects:
## [Television Image Detector with CNNs using Tensorflow & Keras](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Television_Image_Detector.ipynb)

- An image processing system is designed that takes any image from the internet and detects the presence of a television in the image.
-  The convolutional neural network model is trained using a dataset that is created from scratch using an ImageScraper notebook which outputs a .csv file of image URLs from DuckDuckGo search images.
-  An accuracy of 82.81% is achieved from test set which is good for an Image Processing model that only has 850 training images with few layers in the neural network.

## [Data Exploration: John Hopkins University COVID19 Data Exploration & Analysis with World Happiness Report](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/john_hopkins_covid_data.ipynb)

- This is primarily a Data Exploration project and its about finding insights and various correlations between values of two datasets.
- Worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in each Country.
- Another dataset called the world happiness report which consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
- The datasets were cleaned, merged and correlated to form relationships between the maximum infection rates and factors of happiness across countries.
- Contains relevant figures and plots.

## [Handwritten Digit Recognition with Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras (Improved version)](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_with_Tensorflow_2_0_%26_Keras.ipynb)

- This project is an improved version of the previous Digit Recognition project as this is done with Keras.
- Used hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and built a neural network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
- Convolutional Neural Networks were built and flattened to later add dense layers, all done with Keras
- Accuracy of 98% is achieved by this model on the test data this time as opposed to 92% accuracy before.

## [Digit Recognition of Handwritten Text with Tensorflow 1.x](https://github.com/mowne67/Portfolio-Mowne/blob/main/Digit_Recognition_from_Handwritten_Text_with_Tensorflow_1_x.ipynb)

- Used hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and built a neural network to recognize and predict the correct label for the digit displayed.
- Successfully trained that neural network to classify the MNIST dataset with around 92% accuracy on the test data.
- Used an older version of tensorflow (1.x)
